Maa Vindhyawasini Marble

This project was carried out as part of the Business Development Management capstone under the B.S. in Data Science program at IIT Madras.

The study focuses on a 20+ year old tiles and sanitaryware dealership in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, currently navigating declining customer footfall, rising competition, and strategic expansion decisions. The primary objective of the project is to support data-backed decision-making for sustainable business growth.

The project evaluates showroom expansion feasibility, demand trends, and inventory challenges by combining historical business records with on-ground market understanding. The outcomes aim to help the business identify the right timing for expansion, focus on high-demand product categories, and reduce inventory risks in a competitive small-town market.
